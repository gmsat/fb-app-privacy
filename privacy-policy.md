_Last updated: August 16, 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how this application (“the App”) handles information when interacting with the Facebook Graph API and related services. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## 1. Information We Collect
When you connect your Facebook account, the App may access certain information from Facebook depending on the permissions you grant. This may include:
- Basic profile information (e.g., name, user ID, profile picture)  
- Email address (if permission is granted)  
- Other data that you explicitly allow through Facebook permissions  

The App does **not** collect any other personal information beyond what Facebook provides through its API.

## 2. How We Use Information
The collected information is used solely for the purpose of enabling automated workflows and integrations via **n8n**. Specifically:
- To connect your Facebook account to n8n workflows  
- To process actions and retrieve data as requested by your workflows  

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

---

## 3. Data Retention
We retain data only as long as necessary to operate the App and provide workflow functionality. Temporary access tokens or data retrieved from Facebook may be stored for workflow execution but are not stored longer than required.

---

## 4. Data Deletion
You have the right to request deletion of your data at any time. To request deletion:
- Contact us at **privacy.workflow.app@protonmail.com**  
- Upon request, all stored data associated with your account will be permanently deleted.

## 5. Sharing of Information
We do not disclose your information to outside parties except as required by law.

## 6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
This App is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us for deletion.
